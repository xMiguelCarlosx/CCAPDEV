ISSUES FROM MCO2 

1. chosen seats are missing the date component
2. unclear what the search from reserve page is for
3. reserve anonymously is done per booking, not a flag that is set from profile settings (same comment from phase 1)

4. same comment from phase 1: seat reservation should have a start time and end time instead,
 to allow for the reservation of multiple timeslots at once (address this for phase 3)

5. web app initially not working. It appears that you have simply routed every page in your express app. 
This is fine, but you have forgotten to include the script.js file as part of your static files--making the entire web application non-functional. 
I had to make some revisions to your source code to make it functional again. Please test your webapps before submitting

6. edit and delete reservations inaccessible / not functional
7. lab technician should only be allowed to create / edit / delete reservatons for students, 
   not give full access to their accounts
